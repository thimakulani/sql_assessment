Concurrency Issues: If multiple users execute the stored procedure concurrently for the same department, it might lead to concurrency issues like race conditions or inconsistent data updates. For example, one user's changes might overwrite another user's changes if proper transaction isolation levels are not set.

2.1.1 Employees, Departments
2.1.2Increased Storage Space: Indexes require additional storage space on disk to store index data structures. This can lead to increased storage costs, especially for large databases with many indexes.

Overhead During Write Operations: When data is inserted, updated, or deleted in a table, indexes need to be updated accordingly. This overhead can slow down write operations, especially for tables with many indexes.

Impact on Insert and Update Performance: Inserting or updating rows in a table with indexes can be slower due to the need to update the index data structures. This impact becomes more significant as the number of indexes on a table increases.

Index Maintenance Overhead: Indexes need to be maintained to ensure they remain accurate and up-to-date. This maintenance operation can consume system resources and may lead to increased CPU and I/O usage.

Increased Disk I/O: While indexes can speed up data retrieval by allowing the database engine to quickly locate rows, they also introduce additional disk I/O overhead. This can lead to increased disk I/O operations, especially for frequently accessed indexes.

Index Fragmentation: Over time, indexes may become fragmented as data is inserted, updated, or deleted in the table. Fragmentation can lead to decreased index performance and may require periodic maintenance to defragment indexes.

Query Optimizer Overhead: The query optimizer needs to consider the available indexes when generating query execution plans. Having a large number of indexes can increase the complexity of query optimization and may lead to suboptimal query plans in some cases.

Indexes Can Become Outdated: If indexes are not properly maintained or if the data distribution in the table changes significantly, indexes may become outdated and less effective. Regular monitoring and maintenance are required to ensure indexes remain relevant and provide optimal performance.
